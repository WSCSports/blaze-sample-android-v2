# Blaze SDK Android Sample App

## Overview

The Blaze SDK Android Sample App provides practical examples of how to integrate WSC Sports' BlazeSDK into your Android application. It includes multiple sample modules that demonstrate different aspects of the SDK, from basic widget implementation to advanced features like universal links, push notifications, and custom styling.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download the project zip file or clone the repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WSCSports/blaze-sample-android-v2.git
cd blaze-sample-android-v2
```

### 2. Configure API Key

The BlazeSDK requires an API key to function. You need to add your API key to the `local.properties` file:

1. Open or create `local.properties` in the root directory
2. Add your BlazeSDK API key:

```properties
# BlazeSDK API Key
BLAZE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

**Note**: The `local.properties` file is ignored by git for security reasons. Never commit your API keys to version control.

### 3. Sync and Build

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Click "Sync Project with Gradle Files"

### 4. Run the Application

1. Connect an Android device or start an emulator
2. Run the app using the play button

## BlazeSDK Integration Guide

### Initialize the SDK

The BlazeSDK needs to be initialized in your Application class. Here's example for initialization pattern:

```kotlin
// In your Application class onCreate() or Activity
BlazeSDK.init(
    // Add your own API key in local.properties file as BLAZE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    apiKey = BuildConfig.BLAZE_API_KEY,
    cachingLevel = BlazeCachingLevel.DEFAULT,
    cachingSize = 512,
    sdkDelegate = Delegates.globalDelegate,
    playerEntryPointDelegate = Delegates.playerEntryPointDelegate,
    completionBlock = {
        Log.d(TAG, "BlazeSDK.init success completionBlock..")
    },
    errorBlock = { error ->
        Log.e(TAG, "BlazeSDK.init errorBlock -> , Init Error = $error")
    },
    externalUserId = null,
    geoLocation = null,
    forceLayoutDirection = null
)
```

### Dependencies

The BlazeSDK is declared in the `libs.versions.toml` file and included as a dependency in the app's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // BlazeSDK
    implementation(libs.blazesdk)
    
    // Other required dependencies...
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**:
   - Verify the API key is correctly added to `local.properties`
   - Ensure the key format matches: `BLAZE_API_KEY="your_key_here"`
   - Check that the key is valid and not expired

2. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure Android SDK is updated to API 35
   - Sync Gradle files after any configuration changes
   - Check internet connection for dependency downloads

3. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Verify the BlazeSDK is properly initialized
   - Check logcat for specific error messages
   - Ensure minimum SDK requirements are met
